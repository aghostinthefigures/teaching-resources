# Teaching Resources
Here are a list of some resources I’ve cobbled together for teaching in engineering/physics/math fields, mostly consisting of MATLAB Live Scripts or deployed Mathematica objects. Feel free to use them, with proper attribution, in your own teaching endeavors.

You should have the ability to open and run the MATLAB Live Scripts listed below by clicking on the "Open in MATLAB Online button" next to each entry **even if you do not have a license for MATLAB or have MATLAB installed**; you only need to create a free MATLAB account and you should be able to run them.

## Dynamics
- A simulator to visualize the motion of a mass suspended by a rubber band, intended to make students familiar with spring-pulley problems and when their physical assumptions fail.

- A simulator to visualize the motion of a stick-on-a-spring under the influence of gravity, intended to teach students about unpredictability in dynamics.

- A mass-spring simulator designed to help students become familiar with normal modes.

- A simulator to visualize the motion of a disk-in-a-pipe under the influence of gravity, intended to teach students about “rolling without slip” and its effects on motion.

## Applied Mathematics
- A plotter to calculate and visualize the expressions $\nabla\cdot\left(\phi\vec{u}\right)$ and $\vec{u}\cdot\left(\nabla\phi\right)$ given an input vector field $\vec{u}$ and scalar field $\phi$, designed to help students develop intuition for the similarities and differences between these common expressions in fluid dynamics.

- An interactive activity on the connection between approximation convergence and the existence or non-existence to solutions of boundary-value problems.

- An interactive, basic introduction to coding in MATLAB and manipulating arrays of numbers.

## Fluid Mechanics
- A simulator to visualize the deformation of a fluid element within a fluid flow. [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=aghostinthefigures/teaching-resources&file=lumleyproto.mlx)
- A simulator to demonstrate the change of center of buoyancy as a function of tilt angle for a boat with and without outrigger floats. [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=aghostinthefigures/teaching-resources&file=BoatSimulator.mlx)
## Heat Transfer
- A simulator to visualize how the temperature profile of a planar wall changes as a function of time and space due to transient 1-dimensional heat conduction for a variety of customizable boundary conditions.
