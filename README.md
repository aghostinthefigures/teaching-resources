# Teaching Resources
Here are a list of some resources Iâ€™ve cobbled together for teaching in engineering/physics/math fields, mostly consisting of MATLAB Live Scripts or deployed Mathematica objects. Feel free to use them, with proper attribution, in your own teaching endeavors.

You should have the ability to open and run the MATLAB Live Scripts listed below by clicking on the "Open in MATLAB Online button" next to each entry **even if you do not have a license for MATLAB or have MATLAB installed**; you only need to create a free MATLAB account and you should be able to run them.

## Dynamics
- A simulator to visualize the motion of a mass suspended by a rubber band, intended to make students familiar with spring-pulley problems and when their physical assumptions fail.
- A simulator to visualize the motion of a stick-on-a-spring under the influence of gravity, intended to teach students about unpredictability in dynamics.
- A mass-spring simulator designed to help students become familiar with normal modes.
